Day 3	Worked with the Sakila Movie Rental Database using MySQL to perform real-world data analysis through structured queries.	Analyzed customer behavior by writing SQL queries that included SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions to extract insights such as top customers by rentals and high-value payers.	Applied INNER JOINs to combine data across multiple tables and used subqueries to compare customer payments against the average.	Created a view to represent high-value customers and implemented an index on key columns to demonstrate basic query optimization techniques.
